INTERMITTENT FASTING

In the past decade, intermittent fasting (IF) has increasingly gained popularity as a health strategy. The practice has been gaining popularity particularly in the bodybuilding, weight loss and ketogenic communities. Individuals now make use of IF as a tool to help stay healthy or lose weight. People tend to become less active as we age or because of the nature of their job. Everybody including those who make healthier food choices is prone to eating too much. Even though fasting is an age long religious practice, few are aware that it has health benefits. For example, some Christians all over the world fast for 40 days every year during the period of Lent, while other sects fast according to different schedules. Muslims fast for a month during the annual Ramadan Fast. In Buddhists monastic communities, fasting is viewed as an ascetic practice that emphasises moderation. Most of these religions adopt fasting as a practice to purify their bodies, to teach moderation - removing indulgences, for spiritual enlightenment, for compassion – limiting one’s food intake in order to provide for the poor and needy.



Intermittent fasting is beneficial whether you are a healthy weight and want to promote healthier living or it can help you achieve your aim if you are overweight and need to shed some weight to improve your health. Studies have shown that intermittent fasting has benefits such as better brain function and cancer prevention. IF can also produce similar effects as intensive exercise, including increasing heart rate variability while reducing resting heart rate and blood pressure. According to a study published in the BMC Nutrition Journal, intermittent fasting when combined with calorie reduction is effective for both weight loss and cardio-protection in obese women.



In the past, nutrition health specialists had advocated 3-4 hours space between meals. This meant consuming nutrient-dense, healthy food frequently along with exercise program. Advocates of IF shun the idea of eating frequently and claim that intermittent fasting can help achieve quicker fat loss and more importantly – better health. Some practical examples have shown that the IF approach does not necessarily produce better fat-loss results than conventional diet approach, but it does make it easier to maintain a lower body fat percentage and lower body fat compared to traditional diets. Once you are familiar with intermittent fasting you will notice a change in your appetite. You’ll have less of an urge to eat all day, cravings are reduced or even eliminated, your palette becomes more refined and the tendency to eat healthier increases while the tendency to overeat during the eating window is minimised.

Intermittent fasting is not a diet, rather, it is an eating schedule which involves going through periods of eating and feasting. In intermittent fasting, periods of fasting and feasting are alternated. During a fast you can drink only water and other calorie-free drinks but abstain from eating. You are only restricted to water and calorie-free drinks because juice or even fruits and vegetables can release insulin. However, in the feasting period you eat and drink normally. This schedule of eating and feasting is packed with health benefits.



Since the intermittent fasting practice is not a diet, it has an advantage over traditional dieting practices in that it is simple and clear-cut, you don’t have to keep thinking about food. Once you get over the idea that you need to eat all the time, intermittent fasting is easy to implement. While traditional diets focus on ‘what should I eat or what should I avoid’ - by counting and reducing calories, changing food choices and eating patterns. IF is simple because it focuses on ‘when is my next meal’. In intermittent fasting, caloric reduction happens naturally because there is a smaller eating window.

Even though the principle is to cycle between periods of fasting and feasting, people adopt varying strategies. You should decide the fasting/eating window that works best for you. However, the moment you start eating, you are in your eating window. A fasting window starts the second you stop eating while the eating window starts once you eat. Some recommend going without food once or twice a week for 24 hours; having dinner at night. For example, you could skip breakfast, lunch and snack the next day, then eat a normal dinner. Others suggest fasting daily for 16 hours and consuming food only during an eight-hour ‘eating window’. The length of your eating window will affect your metabolism more than having your eating window at the same time every day. However, once you are used to fasting, mixing the length of your eating window might be a good idea.



It is advised that during the eating window one should abide by the 80/20 principle. That is, ensure that 80% of the food you eat is clean and healthy while the other 20% can be the splurge items that you are craving. Eating a healthy whole-food diet during the eating window is beneficial. While in the ketogenic cycles, the eating window consists of fully ketogenic meals. Vegans have also successfully combined their vegan diets with intermittent fasting. However, you don’t necessarily have to change what you eat but always ensure you eat enough calories by eating a variety of nutrient-dense diets.



If you already have a poor diet that is deficient in vitamins and protein, then intermittent fasting can be potentially harmful because eating less food could lead to vitamin deficiency. Such people are advised not to practice intermittent fasting or to offset their deficiency by taking multivitamins. It is also essential to eat balanced meals rather than junk during the eating window to avoid malnourishment. This could also be a problem if fasting is taken to an extreme. It can also be challenging to integrate fasting into your life especially because of social norms and conventions about eating. Social gatherings are also potential challenges you will need to anticipate and plan ahead for by tweaking you fasting and eating window.



Though many experts believe intermittent fasting has many advantages over traditional dieting techniques, there are also sceptics. If you are thinking of intermittent fasting, please consult your health professional especially if there are health concerns and then make reasonable judgement for yourself. Please leave a comment if you practice intermittent fasting to let others know how it is working for you.
